# fret-ferret-paper

(main.pdf)[This work] introduces the world's most robust software trainer for the guitar, called \textit{Fret Ferret}, which utilizes the contextual multi-armed bandit class of algorithms, as well as implicit signals from the user, to customize lessons to each user automatically and in real time, avoiding the need to tweak a large selection of game parameters in order to obtain a desired difficulty level. We discuss the consequences of using these algorithms to drive new styles of computer-human interaction that can accelerate our learning process and help us reach new mental achievements. We elaborate on the details of our algorithms, how they inform our user interface design, and how we address the difficulty of scaling the development of a large number of machine learning models to adapt to many mini games and each user individually. Finally, we address future work that can further augment the performance and capabilities of our software.
