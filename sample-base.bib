abstract = {Abstract A multi-armed bandit is an experiment with the goal of accumulating rewards from a payoff distribution with unknown parameters that are to be learned sequentially. This article describes a heuristic for managing multi-armed bandits called randomized probability matching, which randomly allocates observations to arms according the Bayesian posterior probability that each arm is optimal. Advances in Bayesian computation have made randomized probability matching easy to apply to virtually any payoff distribution. This flexibility frees the experimenter to work with payoff distributions that correspond to certain classical experimental designs that have the potential to outperform methods that are âoptimalâ in simpler contexts. I summarize the relationships between randomized probability matching and several related heuristics that have been used in the reinforcement learning literature.

@article{implicit_association_test,
abstract = {An implicit association test (IAT) measures differential association of 2 target concepts with an attribute. The 2 concepts appear in a 2-choice task (e.g., flower vs. insect names), and the attribute in a 2nd task (e.g., pleasant vs. unpleasant words for an evaluation attribute). When instructions oblige highly associated categories (e.g., flower + pleasant) to share a response key, performance is faster than when less associated categories (e.g., insect + pleasant) share a key. This performance difference implicitly measures differential association of the 2 concepts with the attribute. In 3 experiments, the IAT was sensitive to (a) near-universal evaluative differences (e.g., flower vs. insect), (b) expected individual differences in evaluative associations (Japanese + pleasant vs. Korean + pleasant for Japanese vs. Korean subjects), and (c) consciously disavowed evaluative differences (Black + pleasant vs. White + pleasant for self-described unprejudiced White subjects).},

@book{flow,
  abstract = {You have heard about how a musician loses herself in her music, how a painter becomes one with the process of painting. In work, sport, conversation or hobby, you have experienced, yourself, the suspension of time, the freedom of complete absorption in activity. This is "flow," an experience that is at once demanding and rewarding--an experience that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates is one of the most enjoyable and valuable experiences a person can have. The exhaustive case studies, controlled experiments and innumerable references to historical figures, philosophers and scientists through the ages prove Csikszentmihalyi's point that flow is a singularly productive and desirable state. But the implications for its application to society are what make the book revolutionary.

When used individually to estimate a causal effect, both outcome regression and propensity score methods are unbiased only if the statistical model is correctly specified. The doubly robust estimator combines these 2 approaches such that only 1 of the 2 models need be correctly specified to obtain an unbiased effect estimator. In this introduction to doubly robust estimators, the authors present a conceptual overview of doubly robust estimation, a simple worked example, results from a simulation study examining performance of estimated and bootstrapped standard errors, and a discussion of the potential advantages and limitations of this method. The supplementary material for this paper, which is posted on the Journal's Web site (http://aje.oupjournals.org/), includes a demonstration of the doubly robust property (Web Appendix 1) and a description of a SAS macro (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) for doubly robust estimation, available for download at http://www.unc.edu/∼mfunk/dr/.}",

The main result of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.},

We present Let’s Frets - a modular guitar support system that provides visual guidance through LEDs that are integrated into a capacitive fretboard to support the practice of chords, scales, melodies, and exercises. Additional feedback is provided through a 3D-printed fretboard that senses the finger positions through capacitive sensing. We envision Let’s Frets as an integrated guitar support system that raises the awareness of guitarists about their playing styles, their training progress, the composition of new pieces, and facilitating remote collaborations between teachers as well as guitar students. This interactivity demonstrates Let’s Frets with an augmented fretboard and supporting software that runs on a mobile device.},

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to predict mouse click location. Our model, which is LSTM (long short-term memory)-based and trained by joint supervision, can predict the rectangular region of mouse click with feeding mouse trajectories on the fly. Experiment results show that our model can achieve a result of a predicted rectangle area of 58 \texttimes{} 79 pixels with 92% accuracy, and reduce prediction error when compared with other state-of-the-art prediction methods using a multi-user dataset.},
